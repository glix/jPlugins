*This plugin is work in progress!* The plugin will turn your form's file-input box into a tiny image editor. Perform basic image operations and preview your image before uploading to the server. The functionality for the plugin is very similar to the one found in pasteboard.co

So, your good old html form with the file upload field to upload an image:
<p align="center">
<img src="../../raw/gh-pages/img/img1.gif" />
</p>
will change to something more user-friendly:
<p align="center">
<img src="../../raw/gh-pages/img/img2.gif" />
</p>

The plugin supports 3 sources for image data:<br>
1. You can drag-and-drop your image on the widget or search your computer for images<br>
2. You can use your computer/tablet web-camera to make a photo<br>
3. You can copy and paste the image

The plugin supports image rotation, cropping, resizing and pen tool.
Once you're done with the image manipulations you can just upload your form as usual, the updated image will be uploaded along with the form, as if it would be the regular file-upload field.
