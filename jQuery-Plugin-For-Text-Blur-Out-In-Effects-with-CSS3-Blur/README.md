jQuery.Blur
===========

jQuery Blur gives your dom elements a blur effect fading in and out with many different styles.

The API is super simple!!!
<pre>
$(this).blurOut(1000);
</pre>
This will blur out text in 1000ms.
<pre>
$(this).blurIn(1000);
</pre>
This will blur in text in 1000ms.

If you want to have a different text color. You will have to use the bColor attribute.
<pre>
&#60;h3 bColor="green"&#62;This will be green&#60;/h3&#62;
</pre>

It's basically just an add on for the original jQuery features.

Please note that this is a CSS3 Transform and you will need jQuery transit!
